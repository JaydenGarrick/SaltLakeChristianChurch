###### Description
Salt Lake Christian Church is an app created for a non-profit church. The goal of the app is to bring members of the church together and helps to stay organized, but also offer an array of features non-members can access as well, such as the calendar, lesson RSS feed, and announcement tab.


## Technologies used
Firebase, RESTful APIs, CoreData, Autolayout, XMLParser, AVFoundation

# Firebase
Firebase was used to create a directory for members that are able to sign in / sign up. Firebase is also used for the creation of announcements, such as important upcoming events.

# RESTFul APIS
Implemented Google Calendar API to keep members up to date with all events happening within the church. Automatically updates with the calendar, and can refresh within the app.

# CoreData
Used coredata to handle the blocking and hiding of user generated content. Because creating an account is only a member feature, had to implement another method besides Firebase to handle apple's guidelines on user generated content.  

# Autolayout
Implemented Autolayout to handle all UI design. Managed to create complex designs with efficient, adaptive constraints.

# XMLParser and AVFoundation
XML parsing was used primarily for the RSS feed. The church hosts a podcast that has recordings of all sermons and guest speakers talks / lectures. Created a audio player using AVFoundation, and used a download task with the .mp3 URL from the XML to play the audio.

# Highlights
Managed to work with a client and exceed all expectations in a timely manner.
